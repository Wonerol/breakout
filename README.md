# Breakout
_Dusting off my C++ and OpenGL_

A simple Breakout clone with OpenGL, made as a two-week project to learn more about modern OpenGL and provide a fun way to brush up on C++. 
Built on Linux with [glfw](https://www.glfw.org/) and [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)

Compilation is simple:
`make`

Running it is equally simple
`./breakout`

You might need to install the following libraries:
- glfw3 
- dl 
- X11 
- pthread 
- xf86vm 
- randr
- Xinerama
- Xcursor
